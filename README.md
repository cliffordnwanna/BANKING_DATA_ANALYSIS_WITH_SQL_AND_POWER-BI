# BANKING DATA ANALYSIS WITH SQL AND POWER-BI

![Banking Dashboard](https://github.com/cliffordnwanna/BANKING_DATA_ANALYSIS_WITH_SQL_AND_POWER-BI/raw/main/PowerBI_report/Dashboard%20Screenshot.jpg)


## Project Overview
This project demonstrates my proficiency with SQL and Power BI by analyzing a sample banking dataset. The dataset consists of two tables: **Customers** and **Transactions**, both designed to simulate real-world banking operations. Using SQL for database management and Power BI for data visualization, I have created a professional dashboard to derive actionable insights.

## Dataset Description

### **SQL Source**
The dataset was created and managed using SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS). It consists of the following tables:

#### **Customers Table**
This table contains demographic information about customers, with the following columns:
- **CustomerID**: Unique identifier for each customer.
- **Name**: Full name of the customer.
- **Age**: Age of the customer.
- **City**: The city where the customer resides.
- **AccountType**: Type of account held (e.g., Savings, Current).

#### **Transactions Table**
This table records financial transactions, with the following columns:
- **TransactionID**: Unique identifier for each transaction.
- **CustomerID**: Identifier linking the transaction to the respective customer.
- **TransactionDate**: Date of the transaction.
- **Amount**: Monetary value of the transaction.
- **TransactionType**: Type of transaction (e.g., Deposit, Withdrawal).

The `CustomerID` column acts as a foreign key, establishing a relationship between the two tables.

## Steps to Import Data into Power BI

### **Step 1: Set Up SQL Database**
1. Designed and created the `BankAnalytics` database in SSMS.
2. Populated the `Customers` and `Transactions` tables using SQL `INSERT` statements.

### **Step 2: Connect Power BI to SQL Server**
1. Opened **Power BI Desktop**.
2. Selected **Get Data** > **SQL Server**.
3. Entered the server name and database name (`BankAnalytics`) to connect.
4. Selected the `Customers` and `Transactions` tables for analysis.
5. Clicked **Load** to import the data into Power BI.

### **Step 3: Establish Relationships**
1. Navigated to the **Model view** in Power BI.
2. Verified the relationship between the `Customers` and `Transactions` tables (linked via `CustomerID`).

### **Step 4: Data Cleaning**
1. Checked and adjusted data types for columns (e.g., `TransactionDate` set as Date, `Amount` as Decimal).
2. Ensured no null values or duplicates existed.

## Challenges Encountered

1. **Database Creation Errors:** Initially, I encountered errors stating that the database and tables already existed. This was resolved by verifying the database using SQL queries and refreshing SSMS.
2. **Relationship Setup:** The tables had to be carefully linked via the `CustomerID` field to ensure accurate visualizations.
3. **Data Formatting:** Formatting issues with `TransactionDate` required attention to ensure proper visualization of time-based trends in Power BI.

## Key Visuals and Their Purpose

### **1. Customer Summary (Card Visual)**
- **Purpose:** To display the total number of customers in the dataset.
- **Details:** A single card visual showing the count of unique `CustomerID`s, providing a quick snapshot of the customer base.

### **2. Transaction Trends (Line Chart)**
- **Purpose:** To analyze transaction trends over time.
- **Details:**
  - **X-Axis:** TransactionDate.
  - **Y-Axis:** Sum of `Amount`.
  - **Insights:** Highlights peak transaction periods, seasonal trends, and overall financial activity.

### **3. Customer Age Distribution (Bar Chart)**
- **Purpose:** To understand the age demographics of customers.
- **Details:**
  - **X-Axis:** Age groups.
  - **Y-Axis:** Count of `CustomerID`s.
  - **Insights:** Identifies the most common age groups among customers.

### **4. City-Wise Transactions (Map Visual)**
- **Purpose:** To visualize transaction activity across different cities.
- **Details:**
  - **Location:** City.
  - **Size:** Total `Amount` of transactions.
  - **Insights:** Pinpoints cities with the highest financial activity.

### **5. Transaction Types (Pie Chart)**
- **Purpose:** To show the proportion of different transaction types (e.g., Deposits vs. Withdrawals).
- **Details:**
  - **Legend:** TransactionType.
  - **Values:** Sum of `Amount`.
  - **Insights:** Provides a clear breakdown of financial activity.

## Project Documentation

### **Saved Files**
1. **SQL Script:** Includes `CREATE`, `INSERT`, and `SELECT` statements for the `BankAnalytics` database.
2. **Power BI Report:** Saved as `BankAnalyticsReport.pbix`.
3. **Exported Dashboard:** Exported to PDF for easy sharing.
